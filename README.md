Hello World!!!

### W2
1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?

The rgb values are declared as floats because they are numeric values and they are variated in the continuous range of 0 - 1, which involves decimals. 

2. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?

The _bounce variable counts the number of time the ball bounces, which only makes sense when it's recorded in positive integer. 

3. The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?

Syntax error, because a semicolon is missed at the end of a line of code.
